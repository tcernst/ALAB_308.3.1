// Part 1: Fizz Buzz
// To begin, solve the following classic “Fizz Buzz” problem.
// There are a few different ways to do this - experiment with what you think is the most efficient.
// Once you have solved the problem, ask yourself if there could be another way; and if so, would it be better.

// Accomplish the following:
// Loop through all numbers from 1 to 100.
for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++){
// If a number is divisible by 3, log “Fizz.”
// If a number is divisible by 5, log “Buzz.”
// If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, log “Fizz Buzz.”
// If a number is not divisible by either 3 or 5, log the number.
    if (i % 3 === 0 && i % 5 === 0){
        console.log ('Fizz Buzz')
    }else if (i % 3 === 0){
        console.log('Fizz ')
    }else if (i % 5 === 0){
        console.log('Buzz')
    }else{
        console.log(i);
    }
}
// Remember to commit your solution once it is working.
